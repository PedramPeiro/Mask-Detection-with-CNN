# Face Mask Detection with CNN
This is a project for Artificial Intelligence course in which different CNN methods were applied including well-known algorithms.

In this project I used a dataset uploaded in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection) as a competition, to train CNN models.

The exact explanetion of the preprocessing phase and training models is included in the report, so feel free to take a look at it and understand the steps clearly.
